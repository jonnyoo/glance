//  SecureCredentialManager.swift
//  glance
//
//  Two-tier password storage on top of KeychainManager:
//    1. Session key (256-bit AES) — Touch-ID-gated Keychain item. Unwrapped
//       into memory once per app launch via unlockSession(reason:).
//    2. Encrypted password blob (AES-GCM) — Keychain item, no biometric gate.
//       Meaningless without the session key, so it's safe to read at any
//       time — including from the lock screen, where a Touch ID prompt
//       can't run because there's no app UI to host it.
//
//  Touch ID authorizes the session; nothing currently authorizes each
//  individual unlock beyond that (face recognition will fill that role).
